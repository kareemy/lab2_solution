# CIDM 3312 Lab 2: Review of Lists

The goal of this lab exercise is to review your knowledge of lists in C#. Read the instructions in this file, `README.md`, below. You can view them in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V.

## Task 0
1. Watch the Week 2 videos and read the lessons on WTClass in our Week 2 folder.
2. Accept the assignment invitation link in GitHub.
3. Clone your repository in VS Code.

## Task 1
This repository does not have any starting code. You must create a new C# console application from the Terminal.
1. From the VS Code Terminal, type `dotnet new console`. Make sure you are in the correct folder.
2. Click on the newly created `Program.cs` file in VS Code, wait a few seconds, and click Yes on the popup asking you to Add "Required assets to build and debug".
3. In `Program.cs`, write C# code to create a new, empty list of strings.

## Task 2
1. Add 3 strings to your list using the List `.Add()` method.

## Task 3
1. Iterate or loop through your list with a `foreach` loop printing each element to the console with a `Console.WriteLine()` inside the loop.

## Task 4
1. Save your program and run it. At the terminal prompt, type `dotnet run`.
2. Now is a good time to push your changes to GitHub. Follow the instructions from Lab 1 or my videos to push your changes to GitHub.
       - Try to get in the habit of periodically pushing your changes to GitHub. That is a good development practice.
4. Visit the URL of your GitHub repository in a web browser and verify that your changes are on GitHub.
   
## Task 5 
1. Write code that checks if your list contains a specific string. If it does, remove it from your list.
2. Display a message to the console stating that the specific string was removed from the list or it was not removed from the list.
3. Test this code with a string that exists in your list and a string that does not exist in your list.

## Task 6
1. Clear the list using the List `.Clear()` method.
2. Verify that it is empty by printing the `Count` property of the list out to the console.

## Task 7
Answer the following question by typing your answers right here in `README.md`.

1. What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `foreach` loop?

    **Replace this text with your response.**

## Task 8
1. Save your program and run it. At the terminal prompt, type `dotnet run`.
2. Edit `README.md` and put your name at the top.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
4. Verify that your changes are on GitHub.
6. Congratulations! You have completed this lab assignment. I hope this helped you refresh your C# skills with Lists as well as introduce you to GitHub.
