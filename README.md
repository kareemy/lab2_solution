# CIDM 3312 Lab 2: Review of Classes and Objects

The goal of this lab exercise to review your knowledge of classes, objects and namespaces in C#. Read the instructions in this file, `README.md`, below. You can view them in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V.

## Task 0
1. Watch the Week 2 video and the read lecture notes on WTClass in our Week 2 folder.
2. Clone your repository in VS Code.

## Task 1
This repository does not have any starting code. You must create a new C# console application from the Terminal.
1. From the VS Code Terminal, type `dotnet new console`. Make sure you are in the correct folder.
2. Click on the newly created `Program.cs` file in VS Code, wait a few seconds, and click Yrd on the popup asking you to Add "Required assets to build and debug".

## Task 2
1. Create a new file in the same folder as `Program.cs` called `Widget.cs`. This file is your class. It will be empty initially.
2. Fill in `Widget.cs` the following template code that serves as the basis of most new classes in C#:
  ```
  using System;

  namespace lab2_starter
  {
      public class Widget
      {

      }
  }
  ```

## Task 3
1. Give your Widget Class some properties. Remember, when we get to EF Core every class will have a primary key that will uniquely identify each instance of that class. We will give our Widget Class a primary key and a name:
  ```
  using System;

  namespace lab2_starter
  {
      public class Widget
      {
          public int WidgetId {get; set;}
          public string Name {get; set;}
      }
  }
  ```

## Task 4
1. In `Main` in `Program.cs`, create a new object from the Widget class:
```
Widget widgetOne = new Widget();
```
2. Give `widgetOne` a name and display that name to the console.
```
widgetOne.Name = "Example Name";
Console.WriteLine($"widgetOne.Name = {widgetOne.Name}");
```
3. Create a second widget, give it a different name, and print it out to the console.

## Task 4
Notice how each cs file has a namespace. Right now the namespace always matches the name of your program but it doesn't have to. When our projects get more complex it is helpful to use different namespaces for different classes to better organize your code.
1. Change the namespace of the Widget class to `lab2_starter.Models`.
2. Notice how `Program.cs` now has errors. It can't find the Widget class anymore because it is in a different namespace. You need to use the `using` directive to bring in your Widget class.
3. Near the top of `Program.cs` on Line 2, right under `using System;` add a second using directive:
`using lab2_starter.Models;`

## Task 5
1. Save your program and run it. At the terminal prompt, type `dotnet run`.
2. Edit `README.md` and put your name at the top.
3. Push your changes to GitHub:
    - Click the source control icon in VS Code
    - Type in a commit message
    - Click the checkbox icon to commit. (Click yes on the message box to stage your commit)
    - Click the 3 dots icon (...) for more actions and click Push.
4. Or you can push your changes to GitHub using the Terminal:
    ```
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push
    git status
    ```
4. Verify that your changes are on GitHub.
6. Congratulations! Your lab 2 assignment is complete.
